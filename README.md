# text_to_voice
Adding text-to-voice functionality to your website can make it more accessible and user-friendly. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can create a feature that converts text content into speech, benefiting users with visual impairments or those who prefer audio content. This project explores the Web Speech API and inclusive design principles.
